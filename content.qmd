## Workshop Topic Heading

Duplicate this file (or create new .qmd files) for each major section of the workshop. **Remember to add it to the "_quarto.yml" and run `quarto render` in the Terminal to add the page to the deployed website!**

### Workshop Subheading

It is worthwhile to use two "#" for headings and three "#" for subheadings to that the live table of the contents on the right hand side of the deployed website allows easy navigation among sections.
