### Welcome!

This workshop provides an overview of what "version control" systems are and how they fit into collaborative coding within your team. Specifically, **we are focusing here on an introductory approach to version control that focuses on using `git` via RStudio and GitHub**. We are always happy to improve workshop content so please don't hesitate to [post an Issue](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp-workshop-collaborative-coding/issues) on our GitHub repository if you see clear areas for improvement!

To maximize the value of this workshop to you, **we recommend that you take the following steps before the day of the workshop**. Depending on whether you've used RStudio and/or GitHub before you may have already completed some or all of these steps but please read through the following materials regardless to ensure that all participants arrive with a common foundation of installed programs. If anything is unclear, feel free to reach out to us; our contact information can be found in the "Content Creators" tab.

## Programs to Install

**Note for those of you with a dedicated IT team that has sole power to install software on your computer:** you will need to contact them before the workshop to install the following programs.

### R & RStudio

**Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and its more convenient (in our opinion) user-interface: [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)**.

If you already have R, check that you have at least version 4.0.0 by running the following code:

```{r, eval = F}
version$version.string
```

If your version starts with a 3 (e.g., the above code returns "R version 3..."), please update R to make sure all packages behave as expected.

### `git`

**[Install `git`](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)**

**If you are a Windows user**, be sure to follow along with "Option 1" in the instructions linked above! That variant gives some under-the-hood tools we'll implicitly rely on later.
  
## Accounts to Create / Connect

### GitHub

**[Create a GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)** using your web browser of choice.

**[Connect `git` to your GitHub profile](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)**. You may want to [review the "shell"](https://happygitwithr.com/shell.html#shell) (also known as the "terminal" or "command line") to help with this step.

**Create a personal access token (PAT)**. A token is essentially a more secure password that `git` requires and you can create one by running the following code in RStudio:

```{r token-process, eval = FALSE}
# Install the `usethis` and `gitcreds` packages
#install.packages(c("usethis", "gitcreds"))
library(usethis); library(gitcreds)

# Add your GitHub username and email
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe",
                        user.email = "jane@example.org")

# Create a token (Note this will open a GitHub browser tab)
# See steps 6-10 in GitHub's tutorial (link below)
usethis::create_github_token()

# Copy your Personal Access Token at the end of the above step!

# Now, give your token to RStudio
# After you run this line you'll follow some prompts in the "Console" tab of RStudio
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

At the end of the above steps your token should be set! For additional information, see [GitHub's PAT Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) or the [Happy Git with R PAT Tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html). If this seems a little intimidating, please keep in mind that your experience with downloading programs and creating web accounts will help with these tasks even if you have more minimal coding experience!
