This workshop was created and facilitated by a dynamic team that is here to assist you before, during, and after your attendance at the workshop! To learn a bit more about us, see our bios and relevant links below.

As a senior data scientist, the core of Julien's work is to understand the data and computing challenges researchers are facing and help them to translate these challenges into solvable tasks. Julien advises and mentors on how to clean, structure, combine, and analyze their heterogeneous data sets, as well as scaling up their analysis while promoting open and reproducible data science principles.

Julien is also a Lecturer in the [Master in Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program at Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where he teaches “good enough” practices in reproducible and collaborative data science.

## Angel Chen

Angel supports LTER synthesis working groups by developing data pipelines and reproducible analytical workflows to integrate various sources of data. Angel previously worked as a data curator for the Arctic Data Center, helping researchers archive and store their data. Angel recently completed a B.S. in statistics & data science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

As a trained community ecologist, Nick is no stranger to the realities of "messy" environmental data and has learned the `tidyverse` as part of an effort to reproducibly manage those data for analysis and visualization. His zeal for the `tidyverse` is born out of the number of times these tools have allowed him to untangle a rat's nest of idiodsyncratic data and he hopes this workshop will be valuable to all participants.Nick completed his MS in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Iowa State University
